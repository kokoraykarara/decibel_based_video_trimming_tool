# decibel_based_video_trimming_tool
This is a tool designed to automatically detect and remove sections of a video where the audio level falls below a specified decibel threshold. This method is particularly useful for eliminating silent or low-volume parts of a video, ensuring that the final output contains only the relevant content with sufficient audio levels. Non AI.

Example: If "silence_threshold=-20.0" all parts of the video that has a volume below -20 dB will be trimmed out.
